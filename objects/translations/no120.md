<p>At Niewport, July 20, 1780</p>
<p>Here we are at last my dear prince, on this land so<br/>
long awaited, and so much desired. I shut <br/>
myself for a moment, and I think with pleasure <br/>
that you will learn with some satisfaction<br/>
that I have arrived in much better health than I was when I left<br/>
at the time of my departure from Brest. M. de Ternay<br/>
directed our march through gentle seas and under <br/>
the most serene sky. A few things did happen to us, but <br/>
it is up to our general to tell you about them,<br/>
but I want to repeat to you a thousand times, my dear prince<br/>
that I am charmed by the continuity <br/>
you have put into our friendship for me for more than 30 years<br/>
that I enjoy it in moments of contentment,<br/>
that it has served me with infinite resource, <br/>
that I will never forget what you have done for my brother <br/>
at my request, and especially the feeling<br/>
that you showed me at the time of our separation,<br/>
this profession of faith which assures you of all the feelings<br/>
of my heart, must also answer you that the two [brothers] are</p>

<p>will serve the cause to which you have associated them<br/>
with all their means.<br/>
We all have the greatest confidence in<br/>
the general that you presented to the king and that <br/>
he has given us, his perfect agreement with M. de Ternay<br/>
and augurs well for the speed, and the<br/>
mutual aid that the armies of land and sea <br/>
will be in a position to give each other. You must expect<br/>
my dear prince, that this war will be<br/>
expensive and that the regiments will make <br/>
considerable losses, for the utility of the cause,<br/>
for you, for the honor and the glory of the<br/>
arms of the king and of the nation, dispose of everything<br/>
in advance, I beg you, so that we have <br/>
money and soldiers, and be sure that the few Frenchmen <br/>
who are here will deserve the approval of the king and the<br/>
and the interest of all the ministers.<br/>
Farewell my dear prince believe that there are no places<br/>
nor distances not events which can prevent me from being<br/>
very tenderly devoted to you until <br/>
the last moment.</p>
