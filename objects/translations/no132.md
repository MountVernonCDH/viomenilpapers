discovered seven ships which seemed to be coming here<br/>
that before having recognized the strength of these ships<br/>
I decided to give a signal to be ready to sail, <br/>
and in order not to lose a moment <br/>
I have sent an officer to you <br/>
to ask you for two hundred men of troops <br/>
reinforce our crews, which you have been kind enough<br/>
to grant. If I had not been in such a hurry<br/>
I would have had the honor of writing to you.</p>
