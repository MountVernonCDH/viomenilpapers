<p>At the camp of Philippsburg on July 30, 1781</p>
<p>I had the honor of informing you, Monsieur le Duc, in my letter of the 20th<br/>
May last, that General Washington had sent his orders <br/>
to M. le cte de Rochambeau to approach the American army<br/>
in the first days of July. Having been informed on June 9 at Newport that<br/>
that the convoy we were waiting for had arrived the day before in Boston<br/>
the troops were embarked on the tenth and eleventh to go and camp<br/>
Providence, where they waited for and received recruits, <br/>
and some of the effects which the Sagittaire had conveyed, they marched by<br/>
division on the 19th to the North River, where they assembled on the<br/>
on the sixth of this month with the army of Mr. Washington,<br/>
after encamping successively at Waterman Tavern,<br/>
Plainfield, Windham, Bolton, Hartfort, Farmington,<br/>
Waterbury, Breackneck, Newton, Ridgbury, Bedfort and Nort castel;</p>
<p>We marched through difficult country but with such order and<br/>
order and discipline, that no complaint or claim was made <br/>
against anyone.</p>
<p>General Washington raised all his quarters<br/>
as soon as he heard of us at Hartfort, he passed the Hudson on the 25th,<br/>
and encamped the same day at Peekskill, one of his most trusted spies<br/>
had reported to him on the 28th <br/>
that the English were guarding Fort Washington with few men and<br/>
negligence, and that the capture of this fort could give him the facility<br/>
of seizing the Kingsbridge passage,<br/>
to close in on the English in New York, and to cut off all <br/>
communication with the continent, by camping on the heights <br/>
of Harlem. The same day or the day after his meeting with</p>

<p>our small army he decided to attack it on July 3 at daybreak, <br/>
by a corps of 800 men under the command of General Lincoln, whom he had embarked on the 2nd for this purpose in the vicinity of Peekskill. This general, <br/>
who was to descend the North River during the day and night of the second <br/>
at the level of the march of the American army up to three miles from <br/>
Kingsbridge, had orders to disembark and attack on the rear of Fort Washington.<br/>
The Duke of Lauzun, who had joined us on the morning of the second at the camp of Belfor, received <br/>
a special order from General Washington to continue his march, and to attack <br/>
the next day at daybreak, the corps of Lancey's chasseurs <br/>
which occupied Maurisiana. Colonel Sheldon with <br/>
his dragoons his dragoons and one hundred infantrymen, had been detached <br/>
from the American army to assist in this attack at the orders and the <br/>
avant guard of the Duke of Lauzun. The head of of <br/>
our small army directed to Nort Castel, in the morning of of the third, <br/>
could have joined the same day by a forced march<br/>
with the American army, in the vicinity of Kingsbridge,<br/>
but the march of General Lincoln having been discovered<br/>
by two frigates that were going up the river, and <br/>
by a corps of Hessian chasseurs who had left Kingsbridge an hour<br/>
before daylight to cover a search which the English were <br/>
to make in the morning. This general, who could only seize<br/>
Fort Washington by surprising the troops that were guarding it, had no choice<br/>
guarding it, had no other course to take than to disembark his detachment<br/>
his detachment, and to approach the point where Mr. Washington<br/>
had stopped with his army. No sooner had he set out than there was a fire<br/>
he established such a lively fusillade between his rear guard and the<br/>
that it might have had unpleasant consequences for his detachment, <br/>
if the duke of Lauzun who had pushed in front<br/>
him all the Lancey hunters, who were in front of Mauritiana, had <br/>
not shown himself and formed on the rear of these hunters</p>

<p>in a way that makes them worry about their retirement. This<br/>
movement, which was made with great boldness, stopped the hunters' movement<br/>
which became very offensive and strong [...] Mr. Lincoln, who had already<br/>
lost nearly one hundred men, took advantage of this <br/>
to join the American army, which had advanced to receive him<br/>
and General Washington brought it back and encamped it the same day<br/>
day at Philippsburg. He came to see us the next day at the camp<br/>
of Nort Castel, where he ordered us to join him on the day<br/>
of the sixth. Since this last time all the operations were <br/>
reduced to particular reconnaissances and to some shots<br/>
fired from Taritowa and Dobsferry, on frigates and <br/>
some other small corsairs which had gone up the North River on the 15th<br/>
to intercept the navigation of our supplies.<br/>
One of our ships loaded with bread having had the clumsiness to approach<br/>
these frigates during the night was taken, <br/>
some armed barges having advanced to Taritowa<br/>
to burn American boats loaded with powder,<br/>
sergeant and twelve men of the Regt de Soissonnais forced them to withdraw<br/>
and showed themselves in this circumstance in a way<br/>
to deserve praises.</p>
<p>On the evening of the 21st, General Washington and M. le Cte de Rochambeau<br/>
left at the head of five thousand men to approach Kings<br/>
bridge. They spent the days of the 22nd and 23rd reconnoitering<br/>
and drawing up a plan of the works and lines that the English<br/>
the island of New-York, behind the river of Harlem, from the<br/>
from the bridge of Kingsbridge, to the point of Maurisiana, <br/>
and to that of Hors neck, in the sound.<br/>
The duke of Lauzun with his corps, some Americans and the battalion<br/>
of grenadiers and chasseurs of Soissonnais, which were at his orders, folded<br/>
to the left of this march all the posts that the enemies had <br/>
on the continent, he made some prisoners, and facilitated all<br/>
the recognitions of the generals.</p>

<p>On arriving at Mauritiana, General Washington, after having noted<br/>
that a remnant of refugees were fleeing before him, and <br/>
that they would not have time to cross the Harlem river again, if they were pushed<br/>
in a mildly harsh way, and having expressed some regrets of having <br/>
only eight or ten dragoons to fulfill this office, MM de Vauban, de Damas<br/>
Vauban, de Damas, de Closen, de Lamberdi√®re, and Berthier, ayde<br/>
of camp of M. le cte de Rochambeau, had hardly heard him<br/>
that they put themselves at the head of these dragoons, charged, pursued<br/>
and took the refugees as far as the river, in spite of a rather considerable fire from<br/>
and musketry, which they attacked very closely.<br/>
M. de Damas had his horse killed by a cannon shot,<br/>
there was no one wounded in this circumstance nor during the two days that our<br/>
during the two days that our troops remained <br/>
in the vicinity of Kingsbridge, although there was much skirmishing<br/>
and more than 800 cannon shots fired by the English.<br/>
The generals brought back all the troops on<br/>
the night of the 23rd to the Philippsburg camp, they were not<br/>
followed by their rear guard,<br/>
the French detachment was under the <br/>
orders of the chevalier de Chastelux, it was composed of the regiments of<br/>
Bourbonnais and Deux-Ponts regiments, the battalion of granadiers and chasseurs<br/>
of Soissonnais and of the Legion of Lauzun. MM de Charlus, and de<br/>
Rochambeau commanded the battalions of grenadiers and<br/>
hunters of their brigades, MM de Deux-Ponts their regiments<br/>
and M le Mis de Laval the Brigade of Bourbonnais, here is,<br/>
Monsieur le Duc the exact report of what happened<br/>
in North America since the month of June, according to<br/>
all appearances this will end without any <br/>
event that may interest, and our destiny will be to <br/>
camp here as long as we have supplies.<br/>
We are still waiting for M. de Grace, I am afraid that we will wait for him</p>

<p>still for a long time, and even if it arrives in the near future, <br/>
it will not bring us enough means<br/>
to take New York. America would be too<br/>
happy, if our position and his arrival<br/>
would determin Mr. Clinton to withdraw his generals,<br/>
or at least suspend operations in the Carolinas<br/>
the Carolinas and Virginia.</p>
<p>Corwallis has already withdrawn to Williamsburg,<br/>
M. de La Fayette follows him with measure.<br/>
General Green after having made a voyage<br/>
to Augusta in Georgia, has made <br/>
attempts on the fort of [Nenni Six], which did not succeed.<br/>
We believe that he is retiring to Cambden <br/>
and that the great heat will put an end for some time to the<br/>
the operations in the Carolinas and Virginia.<br/>
Arbuthnot has returned to England in person,<br/>
Graves commands his squadron. M. de Barras<br/>
remained with his squadron in Newport, where he awaits M.<br/>
de Grace, and where he is protected by a thousand men<br/>
of American militia and four hundred Frenchmen whom M. le Comte de<br/>
Rochambeau has left there at the orders of M. de Choisy.</p>
<p>If our generals determine to make a further movement forward <br/>
and that they can without inconvenience support their right at the<br/>
North River [which is ... one hundred toise ] from the point of Kingsbridge,<br/>
and their left at New Rochelle, they will omit great</p>
