<p>Gentlemen,</p>
<p>It is to M. le Comte de Rochambeau much more than to me<br/>
to receive the distinguished and flattering testimonies <br/>
that you are willing to give to the conduct <br/>
of the troops that the choice and the confidence of the King had put<br/>
in his hands to serve the cause of your freedom.<br/>
It is by following the intentions of His Majesty, the orders<br/>
the intentions and the example of the general that she had given us<br/>
that we succeeded <br/>
to inspire in you the feelings of esteem and interest of which<br/>
you have just assured yourself by <br/>
the most honorable expressions.</p>
<p>All the chiefs of this army are as I am,<br/>
Gentlemen, very touched by your suffrage. It assures them<br/>
the approval of the King; it becomes<br/>
the most flattering reward for the care they have given themselves to<br/>
the maintenance of discipline in the regiments<br/>
which they command; the private officers <br/>
who have perfectly assisted them will also be penetrated by the<br/>
the same sentiment, and all that holds this army dear<br/>
still sees with satisfaction how much you are<br/>
persuaded that it is to the perfect union which has reigned<br/>
between the American troops, the King's Navy<br/>
and the French Corps under the orders of M. le Comte de</p>

<p>Rochambeau that France and the United States<br/>
are indebted for the successes you are so willing to <br/>
applaud.</p>
<p>Allow me also, Gentlemen, to seize this <br/>
moment to speak to you of our admiration<br/>
for the virtues, talents, and qualities which so particularly<br/>
distinguish His Excellency General Washington; <br/>
we all desire that the homage of our respects and our wishes<br/>
for his happiness and preservation may<br/>
be pleasing to him and answer him for the<br/>
satisfaction we have had in serving under him.</p>
<p>I believe that I can assure you in advance,<br/>
Gentlemen, that the King will be very sensitive to the wishes<br/>
that the inhabitants of the city of Boston are anxious <br/>
to form for the glory of his reign and the <br/>
prosperity of the nation he governs. The<br/>
disinterestedness and wisdom of his Majesty's views <br/>
in all that she has done to support<br/>
the independence of America does not allow us to <br/>
doubt that the forthcoming destination <br/>
of this army will still contribute effectively to the<br/>
the establishment of it. In any place of <br/>
the earth that its orders may carry it, all that<br/>
who compose it will always remember with</p>

<p>recognition of the touching wishes you are forming<br/>
for her on her departure. The assurances<br/>
of your affection and the expressions of your desires<br/>
for the maintenance of an alliance which His<br/>
Majesty regards as one of the happy and significant <br/>
and marked events of her reign, <br/>
leave no doubt as to the duration of this union <br/>
and on the great advantages that<br/>
will result in all times for the two nations.</p>
<p>Nothing moreover Gentlemen could flatter me<br/>
more than the particular signs <br/>
that you are willing to give me of your esteem.<br/>
I beg you to receive, with all the thanks I owe you<br/>
that I owe you, the respectful homage <br/>
of my gratitude and the assurance <br/>
that I will always form the most ardent wishes for <br/>
the prosperity of the United States in general and the<br/>
and the happiness of the citizens of Boston in particular.</p>
