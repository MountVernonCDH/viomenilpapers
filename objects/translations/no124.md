<p>Memorandum concerning the arrival of M. le cte de Grace in North America<br/>
America, and the situation of the allied army at the camp<br/>
of Philipsburg.</p>
<p>As one must suppose that M. le cte de Barras will not have lost<br/>
an instant since the return of the Concord to have embarked<br/>
the troops, the artillery of siege, the powder and the other effects of<br/>
the king left in the stores of Providence and Newport,<br/>
one must trust that his meeting with Mr. de Grace will not experience<br/>
delay nor difficulty, and that it will take place according to all <br/>
appearance before the 1st of February.</p>
<p>In this state of affairs and in the impossibility of attempting<br/>
the siege of New York, given the inadequacy of the means that<br/>
the Americans and their allies can muster for an <br/>
attack of this importance, I think that there is no need to hesitate<br/>
to carry all the French troops to the south<br/>
to the orders of M. le cte de Rochambeau to unite them in a given point<br/>
point with those that M. le Cte de Grace will bring to his<br/>
to follow him, and to have them operate on the spot <br/>
and with the greatest vigor in accordance with the plan determined<br/>
by General Washington and Count de Rochambeau <br/>
in their particular conferences, and as<br/>
there was not a moment to lose in fulfilling these different objects (goals)<br/>
and that the French camped at Philippsburg could go in eight marches<br/>
to the points on the Delaware that were indicated to them, <br/>
after having accompanied the American army to the position that <br/>
General Washington would have liked to choose. In connection with this<br/>
new arrangement, it would be proposed to agree with</p>

<p>Mr. de Grace that just crossed in front of and at the level of the capes of <br/>
the Delaware, and that it was in this river or at its mouth <br/>
that the French troops under the orders of M. le cte de Rochambeau<br/>
were embarked to be carried afterwards to the<br/>
Chesapeack Bay, Charlestown, or any other point<br/>
ordered by General Washington</p>
<p>M. de Bevile and a commissioner of wars, ordered in advance<br/>
to reconnoiter the camps to be taken, <br/>
and the subsistence that could be obtained, between the North<br/>
and the Delaware, could also be secured at<br/>
Trenton, Philadelphia, Chester and other places, of all the ships<br/>
of all the vessels which would be necessary to add to those which would be<br/>
provided by the squadron, for the transportation of the troops and<br/>
and effects of the army.</p>
<p>Upon the arrival of M. de Grace in North America<br/>
M. de Cornwallis must naturally return to Charlestown<br/>
in a hurry. If he had persisted in remaining in Porthmouth, he<br/>
would be so compromised that there would be no need to<br/>
to attack him there after having landed the troops <br/>
with safety in the bay of Chesapeack. According to all<br/>
appearance he would be beaten and could be taken. If on the contrary<br/>
he has returned to New York or Charlestown, Virginia <br/>
will be delivered, and it would probably not be impossible to attack<br/>
the English successfully, in Charlestown or at Savanah.</p>

<p>These various attempts will at least prove to America<br/>
that we served her as soon as we had the means.<br/>
I will add to these reflections that if the troops brought by<br/>
de Grace are not to remain with us this winter, they must be used <br/>
without loss of time, that any enterprise on New York, <br/>
independently of the very great uncertainty of<br/>
success, would entail such slow preliminary arrangements<br/>
either to obtain the subsistence, or for the transport <br/>
and supplies necessary for such a great attempt, <br/>
that there would remain no hope of being able<br/>
to seize this place before the end of this campaign,<br/>
that it must always be remembered that it is defended by<br/>
by a squadron embossed in the Hook, and guarded <br/>
by ten thousand men of troops accustomed for five or six years to the<br/>
to the events of war, and whose leaders, <br/>
who have a reputation, have the most interesting cause to defend in the face<br/>
the most interesting and <br/>
most decisive for their nation, that it would take at least<br/>
eight or ten thousand men on Long Island, eight thousand on the point<br/>
on the point of Kingsbridge, and four thousand on Staten<br/>
Island, to close in on the English in New York and to prevent<br/>
and to dare them any kind of communication with the <br/>
continent on both banks of the North River,<br/>
to attack them with some hope of success,<br/>
assuming that M. le cte de Grace, beforehand<br/>
of everything would have passed the first bar of the Hook</p>

<p>and would have entered with the entirety of his squadron.<br/>
If these various objects cannot be fulfilled in full,<br/>
any enterprise on New York could lead to such an unpleasant <br/>
and such a humiliating outcome, that one need not fear<br/>
that they will ever be determined by the generals<br/>
who command us, whose experience and wisdom <br/>
are so well known, that they will undoubtedly make <br/>
the best use, and the most useful to the cause of America, <br/>
of the temporary means which they will have in their<br/>
in their hands.</p>
