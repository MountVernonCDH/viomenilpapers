<p>Versailles the 5 Xbre 1781</p>
<p>In the detail, Sir, that I put under <br/>
the eyes of the King of what happened at the siege of York,<br/>
the brilliant manner in which you carried off the<br/>
redoubt at the head of the grenadiers has particularly<br/>
fixed the attention of His Majesty, this action <br/>
deserved his praise; he is not unaware of your services<br/>
since you have been in America, especially<br/>
at the first battle of the Chesapeack, and in the <br/>
previous wars in which you were employed.<br/>
His Majesty to mark his satisfaction<br/>
in a way that is as advantageous as it is honest<br/>
has granted you the Government of La Rochelle,<br/>
which is of twelve thousand livres, vacant by the <br/>
death of M. le Pce (Prince) de Montmorency, and the<br/>
first place of Grand Cross which will become vacant<br/>
in the Order of St. Louis, with permission to wear it<br/>
from now on: you will find the<br/>
you will find consequently the mark joined to this letter.</p>
