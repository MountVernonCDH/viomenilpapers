<p>Wethersfield, 22 May 1781</p>
<p>I am sending you, Mr. Baron, the letters I have just <br/>
received from Menonvolle with several other pressing letters <br/>
for the Chevalier Destouches, I agree with Menonville <br/>
for the rental of horses, food and hospitals in the present circumstances, instead of the purchase which seems to me impossible <br/>
with the present paper movements. However, please<br/>
confer with Monsieur l'Intendant, Mr. Laurens, <br/>
and instruct yourself to answer him. I embrace you, my dear<br/>
Baron, from the best of my heart, I found <br/>
General Washington here to be in perfect health.</p>
