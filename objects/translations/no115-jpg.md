<p>Orders and instructions for Monsieur le Baron de Stuben, general<br/>
commanding the American trench, during the day of the 14th<br/>
to October 15, 1781</p>
<p>Baron de Stuben is ordered to occupy the benches <br/>
of the redoubts and the parallel guarded by the Americans for as long as the attack of M. le Marquis de La Fayette will last.<br/>
If unforeseen circumstances should render this attack<br/>
unsuccessful, and if M. de La Fayette was obliged by <br/>
reason to bring back his troops, and the workers destined to complete<br/>
the second parallel, behind the American battery, <br/>
Baron de Stuben will have their retreat protected by all the fires of his<br/>
lines, which will not be able to harm them, he will want to <br/>
conform to the other dispositions of the trench to what has been <br/>
agreed verbally between him and me in this respect.</p>
<p>At the trench in front of York on October 14 at 5 o'clock in the evening.<br/>
