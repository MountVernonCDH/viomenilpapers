<p>Copy of the letter from Gen. Washington to the officer<br/>
Commander of the embarked troops <br/>
Near Colchester on September 12, 1781</p>
<p>M.</p>
<p>From the intelligences which I received from the Baron de la <br/>
Baie, and which Col. Humphreys will communicate to you <br/>
make me deem it necessary to stop the troops <br/>
and to prevent them from going any further <br/>
the present moment - consequently you will stop <br/>
our troops and your troops until <br/>
you are informed that your convoy <br/>
can safely leave the Bay.</p>
<p>I have the honor to be... <br/>
Signed G. Washington </p>
