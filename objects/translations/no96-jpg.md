<p>At the camp of Williamsbourg on 15 September</p>
<p>Count de Fersen brings you this letter, my dear Baron.<br/>
baron. He is first going to hurry <br/>
the departure of our little flotilla to Annapolis, <br/>
if it arrives there as we presume, <br/>
it will learn of the departure <br/>
of Cte de Grasse to fight the <br/>
English fleet. 2Â° to ask you to <br/>
embark as many troops as <br/>
you can on the transports that Mr. de Grasse is sending<br/>
to join flour and biscuits for a month<br/>
which this country is very deprived of<br/>
by the stay of the armies, <br/>
hospital effects for the governor. <br/>
I embrace you my dear baron with the best of my heart.<br/>
my heart The Count of Rochambeau<br/>
The bearer will tell you the rest</p>
