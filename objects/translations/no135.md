<p>At Versailles on July 15, 1781</p>
<p>I am very sensitive, Sir, to the part that you want to take <br/>
of the mark of confidence of which it pleased the king to honor me I<br/>
and if my zeal as well as my pain / efforts<br/>
could suffice, I will be able to succeed.</p>
<p>You have been the witness of the way Mr. Destouches manoeuvred,<br/>
you do justice to the conduct he held on the occasion when he <br/>
encountered the enemy. This proves that in war the best maneuvers<br/>
are not always crowned with success; it is unfortunate indeed that<br/>
that you were not able to penetrate Chesapeack Bay, it is to <br/>
be believed that if you had been able to keep the enemy out, <br/>
Mr. Arnold would have been taken and the affairs of the South might have changed.<br/>
The arrival of M. de Grasse will present you with a new opportunity, I<br/>
wish it to be a happy one and do not doubt the part you will have in the success<br/>
in the success of our arms.<br/>
I have the honor of being, with the most inviolable attachment, Monsieur<br/>
your most humble and obedient servant.<br/>
Castries</p>

<p>I have made known to the parents (family members) of the persons you have designated to me in the account that you give of the combat, what you tell me me. Based on your account, I regret very much that my son had not been under your <br/>
your orders.  </p>
