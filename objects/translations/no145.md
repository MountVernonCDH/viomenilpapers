<p>Copy of the letter written to M. le Mis de Ségur<br/>
by M. le cte de Custine at Newport on May 29, 1781</p>
<p>I have the honor to give you an account of an event which occurred<br/>
following several acts of indiscipline on the part of some officers of the<br/>
of the regt of Saintonge which I command, which makes an<br/>
example necessary.</p>
<p>Mr. de la Chesnaye, lieutenant in 1st in this regt, about a month ago,<br/>
after a very long dinner, went to my house with an auxiliary officer <br/>
of the Navy; after having reasoned a lot, <br/>
and having given him the advice to put himself in a position to make <br/>
wise reflections, he returned to the house <br/>
where he had dined, from where he wrote me the most inappropriate letter, from an<br/>
officer to his chief, <br/>
after having made him understand the impossibility in which I<br/>
would be, to not to make <br/>
an example, if his actions had been known, I ordered him to be<br/>
the prison where he remained 3 weeks; he left <br/>
after about eight days, and yesterday, the 28th, having come to see me towards the evening<br/>
to report to me that M. de la Valette, lieutenant colonel of the regiment<br/>
had had a second lieutenant appointed to the detachment of a<br/>
second captain and 4th squads, which had just been ordered to be embarked<br/>
at a time when I and M. de Charlus had not been present to decide<br/>
on it; after asking him <br/>
what the tour of duty might be, having verified <br/>
that his complaint was unfounded, I replied that I could not<br/>
reverse the established order of service, and that the decision<br/>
of M. de la Valette having been founded only on justice, <br/>

<p>assembled a great number of officers of the army, with the great scandal <br/>
of all, to the astonishment of several chiefs who were present, he <br/>
allowed himself the most dishonest remarks on the major and <br/>
the Lt. Col. of the regiment, in particular the latter, a respectable soldier <br/>
in all respects, and by his services and by his zeal and his great <br/>
conduct so contrary to the spirit of the orders, so marked by indiscipline <br/>
needs an example, and I have the honor to ask you, Sir<br/>
with the greatest of urgency, to grant <br/>
to my request, it is the breakup of M. de la Chenaye which I would say <br/>
must be this just and very necessary example.</p>
<p>M. le cte de Rochambeau gave orders <br/>
to have him taken to Europe, and I have no doubt that he is willing to <br/>
join in my request to urge you, Sir, <br/>
to be willing to set the example I desire. I am &amp;c... </p>
