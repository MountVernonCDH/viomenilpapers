<p>February 1781{ (wrong date according to the context: it should read March or April) }</p>
<p>As soon as we arrived in North America, Sir, the forces of England were so superior that it was impossible for us to make the slightest attempt.<br/>
We were reduced to the offensive, and it was so well combined by our generals<br/>
and sea, that Admirals Rodney, Arbuthnot, and Greves with 22 ships of the line and General Clinton with 15,000 men of good troops did not<br/>
thought it necessary to attack us. Although we did not act, our presence in Newport<br/>
has not been useless to America, since it has probably been <br/>
one of the principal causes of the success of its commerce as well as of the perfect inaction of the English in the North of the continent, and that all their operations were reduced to movements in the Carolinas<br/>
which they have made better known in their gazettes than they have<br/>
been of any real use to them. Even the happiest actions they have had <br/>
since the capture of Charlestown, having been of no advantage to them in subduing<br/>
the different provinces of the South of America, which they only travel through with<br/>
with considerable expense in money, and losses in men which weaken them more and more each day; to give however still more consistency<br/>
to the operations of the generals of Cornwallis and Lee, Messrs Clinton and Arbuthnot<br/>
sent towards the end of December a corps of 1500 men under General Arnold with<br/>
a 50-gun ship, three frigates and a number of transport vessels, to Chesapeack<br/>
Bay to form a settlement in Virginia. The general<br/>
first sailed up the James River to Richemont where he seized<br/>
the stores which the Americans had not had time to destroy, he <br/>
then returned to Elizabeth's, established and entrenched himself at Portmouth<br/>
and camped his troops between this river and the western branch. It was <br/>
from this very circumscribed position that his detachments do the most harm<br/>
that they can do to the state of Virginia, and it is the desire to deliver that province from<br/>
from the depredations it is experiencing that gave rise to the departure of the royal squadron and to the events of which I have the honor of sending you the attached details.</p>
<p>In addition, M. Destouches maneuvred, served the king and the cause of America on the 16th with a distinction which must do him the greatest honor<br/>
and assure him the esteem of our enemies, he was perfectly assisted by all the captains and officers of his squadron. Our land troops have earned his esteem<br/>
and were useful. His combat was audacious and sustained with a vigor that we all admired.<br/>
What I saw finally M in this day of good tone, the resolution of the officers of the Navy, as well as the joy of all the crews at the time and during the fight <br/>
touched me to the point of tenderness. Without the misfortune of the Conqueror, whose rudder had been broken and which was moreover very degreased M. Destouches<br/>
would have attacked the English squadron a second time, and the chances<br/>
would perhaps have been favorable to us. It is very unfortunate to have been<br/>
forced to give up an expedition that could both deliver Virginia and have an <br/>
influence on the affairs of America.</p>

<p>I don't tell you anything about my particular pain,<br/>
it will be easy for you to imagine it. I beg you to believe, however, that it is mainly due to the regret of having missed this opportunity to justify<br/>
the confidence of Count de Rochambeau and to make useful to America the operation with which he had<br/>
charged me with. I have the honor to be with the most respectful attachment.</p>
<p>M. le Mis de Laval was on the Conqueror, he gave the best example,<br/>
he had a bruise which has no follow-up.</p>
<p>M. le vicomte de Noailles and Messrs de Damas, de Scheldon, de Chabannes<br/>
and de Lameth have shown themselves everywhere with usefulness and distinction, and are in excellent condition.</p>
<p>M. de Rochambeau is doing wonderfully. I have to praise myself more and more each day<br/>
of the marks he gives me of his esteem and confidence. The return of his son should tell us what we can do in America this year,<br/>
you can see, my dear duke, that we are waiting for him with some impatience.<br/>
M. de Rochambeau had entrusted the young Damas to me for the entire time that my expedition lasted.<br/>
I have been with him during the twenty days we were<br/>
on the same ship, to answer you that there are few people <br/>
of his tribe, and of his age, who are of his high standards. <br/>
He showed himself in combat in such a perfect manner<br/>
that it was noticed and applauded by M. le<br/>
dear Destouches and by all the officers of the Duke of Burgundy.</p>
<p>You will also learn with pleasure, my dear Duke, that M. des Solteux<br/>
deserved on the Ardent that M. de Marigny who commands this ship<br/>
and one of the most distinguished officers, gave him several commissions of confidence during the battle.</p>
<p>Whatever the rumors from Paris and Versailles may be<br/>
on the alleged disunion of our small army, be sure, <br/>
my dear duke that there is no other will here than that of the general<br/>
and that the king is served nowhere with more unity, emulation<br/>
accuracy and gayety than in Newport.</p>
