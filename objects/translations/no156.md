<p>On board the Triomphant, February 13, 1783</p>
<p>M. le cte de Rochambeau, the Marquis having decided<br/>
to return to France at the end of the month of September, he gave me at his<br/>
departure from Providence the command which had been entrusted to him<br/>
with the order to have all the regiments of his army embarked,<br/>
the sick and the legion of Lauzun near, on the squadron of M. le Mis de<br/>
Vaudreuil to be carried and disembarked in the points indicated to the<br/>
general by his particular instructions or the appointments which he <br/>
could have taken with the Spaniards. M. de Solano not having been found <br/>
at the one he had indicated and which he had agreed upon <br/>
last year before his departure from St Domingue under the eyes of M. le Mis de<br/>
Galvez, and under those of M. de Bellecombe. M. de Vaudreuil seems to me<br/>
all the more touched that it was only after a very <br/>
stormy crossing and after having lost La Bourgogne which ran aground during the <br/>
night of the 3rd of this month that he managed to get here <br/>
with 5 ships of his squadron, as he informs you <br/>
himself with details of all that had to do with his crossing, and <br/>
the separation of the vessels which he made rest in Cuiracao, or left in the<br/>
in the south of this island, struggling to get there against the currents<br/>
of the greatest force, I will limit myself to telling you that his squadron</p>

<p>has suffered so much since leaving Boston that she will <br/>
not in a condition to set sail even when she is reunited<br/>
before the tenth of next month. This new delay makes it<br/>
all the more painful for me because I must believe that M. le Mis de Galvèz,<br/>
Mr. de Bellecombe, or you sir could have made a useful use<br/>
to the service of the king of the regiments which I must hold at their disposal<br/>
as well as yours.<br/>
I will also inform M. de Bellecombe of my arrival on <br/>
this coast with the request that I inform M. de Galvès so that he can<br/>
consult with you in advance on the employment of the troops that I am bringing <br/>
from North America. When M. le Mis de Vaudreuil can<br/>
have them disembarked in accordance with the orders that he will receive<br/>
directly from the court, or that you can send him.<br/>
The various copies that I have the honor of sending you herewith will inform you <br/>
of the land forces which were embarked on this squadron as well as <br/>
the orders or instructions which were successively addressed to me.<br/>
The letter of M. le cte de Rochambeau dated <span class="unclear">[October 20 (Xbre ?)]</span> having arrived to me in Boston a few hours after our departure<br/>
I received it as well as the dispatches<br/>
that M. le Mis de Ségur had addressed to him, on August 18 and 26,</p>

<p>that on my arrival here, where they were brought by the Auguste, which went there <br/>
directly from Porthmouth, from where she set sail only a few <br/>
days after our departure from Boston. In this state of affairs, even though<br/>
the instruction of the king was not that I embark with <br/>
the troops to which the particular instruction<br/>
of M. le cte de Rochambeau had associated me. As I had warned<br/>
the ministers of war and of the navy before leaving North America<br/>
of my obedience to the orders which had been given to me <br/>
by this general, I now believe it is my duty not to separate myself<br/>
from this army until the King has pronounced on its further destination,<br/>
or that I have placed it in your hands or <br/>
to the disposition of M. le Mis de Galvès or de Bellecombe<br/>
but if while waiting for the first of these times you want,<br/>
M. the Marquis to make me pass your orders I promise you<br/>
that they will be carried out whatever it arrives, or has arrived with <br/>
the zeal and the exactitude which I will always put to what can <br/>
interest the service of the king. If it were better moreover to the utility<br/>
of the thing, to your convenience, or to your particular views, <br/>
that I hand over to my brother the command of the</p>

<p>troops that we brought to South America.<br/>
This would be done at the first word that I would receive from you and it would<br/>
still be satisfactory to me to imagine that it would he woud have maybe the occasion<br/>
to merit more particularly under your orders your esteem and your<br/>
interest.</p>
<p>Even though we have been at sea for 51 days to get here, <br/>
we have very few sick, and without the misfortune of La Bourgogne <br/>
which caused us to lose ten officers and a hundred <br/>
soldiers or sailors, we would have to praise in every respect the good condition <br/>
in which our small army finds itself.</p>
<p>The Fantasque, armed with a float, which had to leave Providence a fortnight after<br/>
after our departure from Boston, to go to Porto Plata being<br/>
loaded with nearly 400 men from different regiments of our small army<br/>
and many artillery and hospital effects, all under the orders<br/>
of M. d'Espeyron, major in the regt of Soissonnais, I will ask M. de Bellecombe<br/>
to kindly order that these men be disembarked and placed <br/>
in the manner which will best ensure their preservation until the <br/>
moment when they will be reunited with their regiments, I will ask him even<br/>
service for two companies of the Rgt de Saintonge embarked on the<br/>
the Allégeance to whom M. de Vaudreuil has also ordered to go to <br/>
Porto Plata in case of separation.</p>
<p>I would not have sent you copies of my orders and instructions if M.<br/>
de Vaudreuil had not assured me that our dispatches would be sent to you<br/>
by safe channels.</p>
<p>It is moreover with the greatest pleasure that I assure you that I seize this opportunity to remember you and to renew to you the assurances of the old and faithful attachment with which I have the honor to be Mr. Marquis....</p>
