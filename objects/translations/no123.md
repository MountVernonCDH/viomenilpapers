<p>M. de Rochambeau will strongly request that M. le Chevalier<br/>
d'Abboville be employed as a brigadier of the day<br/>
or it pleased the king to grant him this distinction, join him, I beg you, <br/>
I pray you my dear general so that this grace<br/>
so well deserved does not cause any obstacle.</p>
<p>If M. de Burelet does not join his battalion, M<br/>
de <span class="unclear">[Bois Loger]</span> is so highly regarded that it will be very well<br/>
to employ him as a brigade commander.</p>
<p>It is always with the greatest pleasure that I renew to you<br/>
the assurances of the old and faithful attachment with which<br/>
I have the honor to be my dear general...</p>
