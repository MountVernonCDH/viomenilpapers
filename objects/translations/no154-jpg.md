<p>M. le mis (le Marquis)</p>
<p>I have the honor to send you the duplicate of my dispatch<br/>
of my dispatch dated this day to M. le Mis de Castries.<br/>
The one I had the honor to send you by the Iris <br/>
before my departure from Boston, had warned you of the orders<br/>
given to me by Count de Rochambeau<br/>
and of my obedience to lead in South America <br/>
the army which had been entrusted to him. <br/>
The orders of the king which you addressed to him<br/>
on August 18 and 29 of last year were <br/>
only returned to me upon my arrival here with the letter of the 20th of October, <br/>
you will see, M. le mis, that I was not able to stay in North <br/>
America or return to France as was <br/>
the intention of his majesty. I wish that the party I have just taken<br/>
and that what I have written to MM. de Bouillé <br/>
and de Bellecombe has your approval and is a new <br/>
proof of my unbounded devotion to <br/>
service of the king.</p>
<p>I have the honor to be with the most respectful attachment<br/>
M. le Mis<br/>
V</p>
<p>I send by this occasion to M. Mis de Castries<br/>
a statement of embarkation similar to the one I had the honor to send <br/>
to you by the frigate the Iris.</p>
