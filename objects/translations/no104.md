<p>Annapolis, 18 September 1781</p>
<p>Leaving Baltimore yesterday morning my dear general to<br/>
camp at Spuries [?], and to continue my march by land <br/>
to Williamsburg, I had organized repeated runs<br/>
with my aydes de camp at Annapolis, to gather all the information which<br/>
could confirm or destroy the hopes which <br/>
the Duke of Lauzun had given to me on the next/quick arrival of a rather large<br/>
of a sufficient number of transports of the squadron to embark the whole of the<br/>
troops of our army, M. de La Villebrusne let me know<br/>
that he had arrived at Annapolis with the Romulus, the Genius and the<br/>
with the Romulus, the Gentille, and nine other ships which<br/>
all together were more than sufficient to carry the troops <br/>
and their crews to their destination, I did not <br/>
hesitate to change the direction of my march, and to go<br/>
with the army, where it has well<br/>
arrived this morning before ten o'clock, I hope that the army <br/>
will be embarked in its totality as well as the field artillery,<br/>
and almost all the crews of the army during the day<br/>
and that we will leave on the 20th in the morning,<br/>
to go to the point that you have prescribed for us.<br/>
As all our cars will go by land to Williamsbourg without</p>

<p>be charged and that I am persuaded that one can save the king more than<br/>
fifty thousand livres<br/>
by sending back all those which cannot be of the least use [...].<br/>
article tomorrow morning with the intendant, and I would order him [...] as I believe you would have done, if you had been<br/>
in my place.</p>
<p>If the winds do not dismay us, we will be on the 24th or 25th<br/>
on the James River, where I beg you to send me your orders, and <br/>
to find sufficient means to transport the tents, <br/>
artillery and all the effects of the army to the point <br/>
you'll have determined to encamp, we are all in joy and good health<br/>
and we will be even happier when we have joined you, receive I pray you<br/>
with kindness my dear general the homage of my tender<br/>
and respectful attachment.</p>
<p>At this moment the frigates the Egrette, the Diligente, the Richemont<br/>
and the Iris arrive to us of supplement to ensure the embarkation<br/>
of all our effects, our empy cars will charge the provisions of flour<br/>
after having passed the Potomack. Some parts of our army,<br/>
General Lincoln and the Duke of Lauzun and our grenadiers and chasseurs left <br/>
during the night of the 15th to the 16th with a fairly favorable wind, I expect<br/>
tomorrow the division of New York<br/>
which [...] will embark this morning in Baltimore on<br/>
the ships I left for them, they will sail with us, <br/>
and we will give them all the help they may need.<br/>
