<p>Reflections and Memorandum presented by M. de Vioménil to M. le Comte de Rochambeau on 10 October 1781</p>
<p>The health of M. de Rochambeau having put him in the impossibility of supervising<br/>
himself the opening of the trench and the work done in front of York, during the<br/>
first eight days, M. de Vioménil who had replaced him as best he could<br/>
and who had judged that from October 10th it was possible to remove the redoubts<br/>
which covered with advantage the entrenchments of Lord Cornwallis,<br/>
delivered to his general the following memorandum, requesting him to give his approval<br/>
its execution to General Washington. This project, which was adopted only for the day of the 14th had the most desired success.</p>
<p>Reflections and project</p>
<p>All that Lord Cornwallis has done since the arrival of the allied troops before<br/>
York, the abandonment of his redoubts and of all the chicanery country he had on his left, his inaction at the opening of our trenches, the little artillery he has so far shown, several of our batteries made within rifle range <br/>
of his entrenchments without attack, and without annoyance on his part, everything<br/>
announces his little resolution or his weakness. if one adds to these reflections<br/>
that he has Glochester guarded by a thousand or twelve hundred men of his army<br/>
one will find that there can be no disadvantage to attack<br/>
the redoubts which are in front of his left and <br/>
which serve him as a great protection, after they have been beaten for <br/>
twenty-four hours by all the American artillery, and by those of our <br/>
batteries of cannon and mortars which can be directed on some of the<br/>
views of the faces, gorges or projections of these redoubts. Prior to this attack<br/>
we would try to burn with combustible materials<br/>
the abatis which are in front of these redoubts, one would oblige the enemies to be<br/>
under arms during the whole night by simulating attacks on their front<br/>
along the great ravine which they have abandoned, and tomorrow, between midday<br/>
and two o'clock, at the moment when the trench is raised, <br/>
and when the English are usually asleep, after having sufficiently<br/>
enforced the trenches, we would come out with nearly five thousand men on these redoubts</p>

<p>on four columns, two of which were American, all of which would be headed by a<br/>
piquet of fifty men carrying each one a large fascine which they would pose<br/>
at the foot of the abatis, and of which they would make a rampart on the faces of these<br/>
works in order to shoot there as much under cover as possible, while the<br/>
columns preceded by carpenters, grenadiers and hunters would attack<br/>
and seize these redoubts by their projections. 50 workers with shovels<br/>
and pickaxes would march after each column, and would be employed without delay<br/>
to fortify these redoubts on the enemy's side. Four pieces of 12 and eight<br/>
pieces of regiment would march to the attack of the French. It would be ordered<br/>
in the same proportion to the Americans. This enterprise which would be<br/>
both brilliant and decisive seems to me to present no cause for concern.<br/>
If Lord Cornwallis wants to support these attacks with all his forces<br/>
he will be very inferior, and will expose himself to being taken on his right and<br/>
by the regiments which, not being in the trenches, could approach <br/>
without being compromised, and show threatening heads. All in all, it is an<br/>
almost sure attack which can decide very promptly on the destruction of the<br/>
of the army corps under the orders of Lord Cornwallis, and prevent it at least<br/>
by the loss of the redoubts on his left to escape one fine night to<br/>
to Rochester, to force us to follow him there, and to delay again of 8 <br/>
or 10 days his captivity and that of the troops that would have followed him.<br/>
Once the redoubts are removed, including the one on the river, he will have no more <span class="unclear">[shelter?]</span> his frigates and his transport ships, and tomorrow night we will support a new parallel which would join our first<br/>
redoubt on the right.</p>
<p>If this project was agreeable to M. le Cte de Rochambeau, and if he agreed to have <br/>
its execution approved by General Washington, it would be easy <br/>
to present to him without delay the disposition that would be made of the troops and the cannon and the points of support that could be given to them to ensure the<br/>
success of these various attacks.</p>
