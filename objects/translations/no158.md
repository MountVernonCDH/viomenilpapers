<p>At the camp of Philippsburg on July 8, 1781</p>
<p>I had the honor to inform you successively, princess, <br/>
of the few events which arrived to us in this part <br/>
of the world, but even though I do not know if my letters <br/>
arrived to you, I do not want to miss <br/>
any opportunity to remind to remind you of me, <br/>
and to renew the homage of my respectful <br/>
attachment.</p>
<p>Our small army has been joined for two days to that of General Washington <br/>
we are strong enough in the camp we occupy to desire to be attacked, but too weak <br/>
however, for us to make any enterprise upon New York,  <br/>
all our forces together do not amount t<br/>
to nine thousand men, in this state of things<br/>
foresee that this campaign will end in this position, <br/>
without any event that might be of interest. <br/>
It is all very well to flatter us that the arrival of M. de Grace <br/>
which they announce for the end of this month or <br/>
the first days of the next one will pull us out of the inaction <br/>
to which we are devoted, I do not expect it to be so soon<br/>
and as he will not bring enough means <br/>
so that we can make the siege of New York <br/>
all that we can reasonably <br/>
desire in our situation, is that <br/>
our weak representation in America was sufficient <br/>
to M. de Vergennes so that he can assure this winter to France <br/>
as glorious a peace as it could have been, if we had been </p>

<p>had given sufficient means to M. le cte de Rochambeau to <br/>
take New York and drive the English out of all America.<br/>
Everyone you know here, Princess, is doing well and behaving<br/>
wonderfully. The Duke de Lauzun, whom you love, called in confidence<br/>
by General Washington, a few days ago, to compete <br/>
with his corps, and an American detachment, which he had sent <br/>
to a combined attack on the advanced posts<br/>
of the English, which chance prevented, but the success of which<br/>
could determine the greatest advantages, maneuvered so well<br/>
and showed himself in two difficult circumstances with such audacity<br/>
and foresight, that he saved <br/>
eight hundred men of American infantry, under General Lincoln, who would have been<br/>
destroyed, had not his movements given cause for<br/>
worry for his retreat to a body <br/>
of Hessian fighters, at the moment when he had <br/>
decided in the most victorious and deadly way <br/>
on the detachment of General Lincoln. I<br/>
still like to assure you princess, that it is impossible <br/>
to be of better example, nor better in all respects, than M. the duke of<br/>
Lauzun, <br/>
Washington and Rochambeau seem to me moreover to agree<br/>
perfectly, to mark him with all kinds of esteem, <br/>
consideration and friendship. For myself I love him with all my heart, <br/>
because I do not know of a more amiable man, and more<br/>
honorable man. De Dillon and Scheldon, in whom you are equally interested<br/>
are behaving perfectly here.<br/>
I beg you, Princess, to keep your <br/>
interest and memory, and to kindly receive the homage of your faithful and<br/>
respectful attachment, which I have devoted to you<br/>
until the last moment.</p>
