# About

This repository holds the source code for the [Correspondance of Baron de Vioménil project](https://viomenil.mountvernon.org). It is created and maintained by the [Center for Digital History](https://www.mountvernon.org/library/digitalhistory) at the George Washington Presidential Library at Mount Vernon; digitization of the papers has been supported by the [Richard Lounsbery Foundation](https://www.rlounsbery.org/). The original papers are held by the [Académie François Bourdon](https://www.afbourdon.com/).

It is built using the CollectionBuilder-CSV template, modified to fit the project -- in particular to add support for transcriptions and translations solicited from content experts and the public using the [FromThePage](https://fromthepage.com/) platform. If you would like to help out, [join the transcription project](https://fromthepage.com/gwbooks/the-correspondence-of-baron-de-viomenil-public)!

# CollectionBuilder-CSV

CollectionBuilder-CSV is a robust and flexible "stand alone" template for creating digital collection and exhibit websites using Jekyll and a metadata CSV.
Driven by your collection metadata, the template generates engaging visualizations to browse and explore your objects.
The resulting static site can be hosted on any basic web server (or built automatically using GitHub Actions).

Visit the [CollectionBuilder Docs](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-docs/) for step-by-step details for getting started and building collections!
